Preparing our dataset\n","<p><em>These recommendations are so on point! How does this playlist know me so well?</em></p>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_449/img/iphone_music.jpg\" alt=\"Project Image Record\" width=\"600px\"></p>\n","<p>Over the past few years, streaming services with huge catalogs have become the primary means through which most people listen to their favorite music. But at the same time, the sheer amount of music on offer can mean users might be a bit overwhelmed when trying to look for newer music that suits their tastes.</p>\n","<p>For this reason, streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. One method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. Today, we'll be examining data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. In doing so, we will learn how to clean our data, do some exploratory data visualization, and use feature reduction towards the goal of feeding our data through some simple machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression.</p>\n","<p>To begin with, let's load the metadata about our tracks alongside the track metrics compiled by The Echo Nest. A song is about more than its title, artist, and number of listens. We have another dataset that has musical features of each track such as <code>danceability</code> and <code>acousticness</code> on a scale from -1 to 1. These exist in two different files, which are in different formats - CSV and JSON. While CSV is a popular file format for denoting tabular data, JSON is another common file format in which databases often return the results of a given query.</p>\n","<p>Let's start by creating two pandas <code>DataFrames</code> out of these files that we can merge so we have features and labels (often also referred to as <code>X</code> and <code>y</code>) for the classification later on.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","Int64Index: 4802 entries, 0 to 4801\n","Data columns (total 10 columns):\n"," #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------            --------------  -----  \n"," 0   track_id          4802 non-null   int64  \n"," 1   genre_top         4802 non-null   object \n"," 2   acousticness      4802 non-null   float64\n"," 3   danceability      4802 non-null   float64\n"," 4   energy            4802 non-null   float64\n"," 5   instrumentalness  4802 non-null   float64\n"," 6   liveness          4802 non-null   float64\n"," 7   speechiness       4802 non-null   float64\n"," 8   tempo             4802 non-null   float64\n"," 9   valence           4802 non-null   float64\n","dtypes: float64(8), int64(1), object(1)\n","memory usage: 412.7+ KB\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Read in track metadata with genre labels\n","tracks = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/fma-rock-vs-hiphop.csv\")\n","\n","# Read in track metrics with the features\n","echonest_metrics = pd.read_json(\"datasets/echonest-metrics.json\", precise_float=True)\n","\n","# Merge the relevant columns of tracks and echonest_metrics\n","echo_tracks = pd.merge(tracks[['track_id', 'genre_top'] ], echonest_metrics, on=\"track_id\", how=\"inner\")\n","# Inspect the resultant dataframe\n","echo_tracks.info()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"10"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"source":["## 2.

Does balancing our dataset improve model bias?\n","<p>We've now balanced our dataset, but in doing so, we've removed a lot of data points that might have been crucial to training our models. Let's test to see if balancing our data improves model bias towards the \"Rock\" classification while retaining overall classification performance. </p>\n","<p>Note that we have already reduced the size of our dataset and will go forward without applying any dimensionality reduction. In practice, we would consider dimensionality reduction more rigorously when dealing with vastly large datasets and when computation times become prohibitively large.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"73"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Decision Tree: \n","               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","     Hip-Hop       0.82      0.77      0.79       230\n","        Rock       0.78      0.82      0.80       225\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.80       455\n","   macro avg       0.80      0.80      0.80       455\n","weighted avg       0.80      0.80      0.80       455\n","\n","Logistic Regression: \n","               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","     Hip-Hop       0.84      0.80      0.82       230\n","        Rock       0.81      0.85      0.83       225\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.82       455\n","   macro avg       0.82      0.82      0.82       455\n","weighted avg       0.83      0.82      0.82       455\n","\n"]}],"source":["# Train our decision tree on the balanced data\n","tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=10)\n","tree.fit(train_pca, train_labels)\n","pred_labels_tree = tree.predict(test_pca)\n","\n","# Train our logistic regression on the balanced data\n","logreg = LogisticRegression(random_state=10)\n","logreg.fit(train_pca, train_labels)\n","pred_labels_logit = logreg.predict(test_pca)\n","\n","# compare the models\n","print(\"Decision Tree: \\n\", classification_report(test_labels, pred_labels_tree))\n","print(\"Logistic Regression: \\n\", classification_report(test_labels, pred_labels_logit))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"80"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"source":["## 12. Using cross-validation to evaluate our models\n","<p>Success! Balancing our data has removed bias towards the more prevalent class. To get a good sense of how well our models are actually performing, we can apply what's called <strong>cross-validation</strong> (CV). This step allows us to compare models in a more rigorous fashion.</p>\n","<p>Before we can perform cross-validation we will need to create pipelines to scale our data, perform PCA, and instantiate our model of choice - <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> or <code>LogisticRegression</code>.</p>\n","<p>Since the way our data is split into train and test sets can impact model performance, CV attempts to split the data multiple ways and test the model on each of the splits. Although there are many different CV methods, all with their own advantages and disadvantages, we will use what's known as <strong>K-fold</strong> CV here. K-fold first splits the data into K different, equally sized subsets. Then, it iteratively uses each subset as a test set while using the remainder of the data as train sets. Finally, we can then aggregate the results from each fold for a final model performance score.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"80"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Decision Tree: 0.7582417582417582 Logistic Regression: 0.782967032967033\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","tree_pipe = Pipeline([(\"scaler\", StandardScaler()), (\"pca\", PCA(n_components=6)), \n","                      (\"tree\", DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=10))])\n","logreg_pipe = Pipeline([(\"scaler\", StandardScaler()), (\"pca\", PCA(n_components=6)), \n","                        (\"logreg\", LogisticRegression(random_state=10))])\n","\n","# Set up our K-fold cross-validation\n","kf = KFold(10)\n","\n","# Train our models using KFold cv\n","tree_score = cross_val_score(tree_pipe, features, labels, cv=kf)\n","logit_score = cross_val_score(logreg_pipe, features, labels, cv=kf)\n","\n","# Print the mean of each array o scores\n","print(\"Decision Tree:\", np.mean(tree_score), \"Logistic Regression:\", np.mean(logit_score))"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
